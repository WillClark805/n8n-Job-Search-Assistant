## Overview
This workflow automates the sourcing, filtering, enrichment, and ranking of job postings in San Francisco‚Äôs tech sector. It specifically targets business operations, product operations, and project coordination roles that align with my transferable experience.

Originally built to support my transition from high-performance kitchen operations into tech, the system now includes a two-stage seniority filter: an initial keyword/date pass early in the pipeline, and a new strict if node later that removes any senior roles before resume parsing and scoring. This ensures only relevant, achievable roles make it to the application stage.
> ‚ö†Ô∏è **This is a redacted version.** Personal document links, API credentials, and private RSS feeds have been removed for security.

### üîß The system:
1. **Collects** postings from targeted RSS feeds for selected tech companies.  
2. **Filters** irrelevant and senior level roles before processing.  
3. **Deduplicates** jobs already stored in Notion.  
4. **Enriches** job data with company metadata, keywords, and technical/functional skill extraction using GPT.
5. **Applies strict seniority filters** to remove any remaining senior roles 
6. **Parses** my resume into structured JSON for matching.  
7. **Scores** job fit using a weighted model for hiring likelihood (experience level, role alignment, technical barrier, and company signals). 
8. **Generates** tailored, ATS friendly base cover letter.  
9. **Updates** Notion database for centralized tracking

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Improvements

###  Key Improvements in v2
- **Improved Job Data Collection -** Expanded extracted fields to include role descriptions, functional keywords, technical skills, and richer company metadata.
- **Updated Ranking System for Skill Alignment -** Rebuilt the scoring logic to weight technical overlaps and domain fit more heavily, ensuring high scores only go to truly relevant roles.
###  Key Improvements in v3
- **RSS Rate Limiting -** Staggered RSS feed collection to respect RSS.app service limits.
- **Fixed Loop Conflicts -** Resolved Split in Batches timing issues that caused incomplete processing.
###  Key Improvements in v4
- **Notion Integration -** Replaced Google Sheets tracking with a Notion database for richer search, filtering, and dashboarding
- **Two-Stage Seniority Filtering -** Added a new strict if node after job enrichment to catch and remove any senior roles that pass the initial keyword/date filter.

## üìö Lessons Learned
- Stronger front-end filtering saves time, tokens, and reduces noise.
- Direct API connections (Google Docs) are more reliable than scraping.  
- A clean caching system improves stability and efficiency.  
- Ranking logic must be customized to your pivot.
- Data normalization is key for downstream processing and filtering.

## üöÄ How to Run Locally
> ‚ö†Ô∏è **This repo contains multiple versions of the workflow.** For the most recent and recommended setup, use n8n Job_Search_Automation_v3.json. Version 1, and 2 are included for historical reference.
1. Clone this repo.  
2. Import `Job_Search_Automation_v3.json` into n8n.  
3. Add environment variables:  
   - `OPENAI_API_KEY`  
   - Google API credentials **Docs**
   - Notion API and database ID
4. Replace RSS feed URLs with your own target company feeds.  
5. Trigger manually or schedule daily runs.
