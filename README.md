# Automated Job Search Workflow (n8n + OpenAI + Google Sheets)

**Version 2.0 — Rebuilt for Accuracy, Efficiency, and Skill Alignment**

## Overview
This workflow automates the sourcing, filtering, ranking, and enrichment of job postings in **San Francisco’s tech sector**, specifically targeting **business operations**, **product operations**, **project coordination**, and **revenue operations** roles aligned with my skill set.
> ⚠️ **This is a redacted version.** Personal document links, API credentials, and private RSS feeds have been removed for security.

### 🔧 The system:
1. **Collects** postings from targeted RSS feeds for selected tech companies.  
2. **Filters** irrelevant and senior-level roles before processing.  
3. **Deduplicates** jobs already logged in Google Sheets.  
4. **Enriches** job data with company metadata, keywords, and technical/functional skill extraction using GPT.  
5. **Parses** my resume into structured JSON for skill-matching.  
6. **Scores** job fit on a custom 1–5+ scale designed for my industry pivot.  
7. **Generates** tailored, ATS-friendly cover letters.  
8. **Updates** a Google Sheet with clean, consistent job records.

## 🛠️ Key Improvements in v2.0

### 1. Improved Job Data Collection
- Expanded extracted fields to include role descriptions, functional keywords, technical skills, and richer company metadata.

### 2. Updated Ranking System for Skill Alignment
- Rebuilt the scoring logic to weight technical overlaps and domain fit more heavily, ensuring high scores only go to truly relevant roles.

### 3. Switched Resume Retrieval to Google Docs API
- Direct API retrieval for cleaner parsing, replacing HTML pulls from the public link.

### 4. Cache Formatting Validation
- Code node added to normalize cached data before reprocessing, preventing workflow errors.

### 5. Enhanced Initial Filtering
- Regex filters expanded to exclude senior, management, and irrelevant roles to reduce token usage and keep Sheets clean.

## 📚 Lessons Learned
- Stronger **front-end filtering** saves time, tokens, and cleanup.  
- Direct API connections (Google Docs) are more reliable than scraping.  
- A clean caching system improves stability and efficiency.  
- Ranking logic must be **customized to your pivot**.
