## Overview
This workflow automates the sourcing, filtering, enrichment, and ranking of job postings in San Francisco‚Äôs tech sector. It specifically targets business operations, product operations, and project coordination roles that align with my transferable experience.

Originally built to support my transition from high-performance kitchen operations into tech, the system now includes a revamped ranking model. Instead of just skill overlap, it focuses on real-world hiring likelihood. It prioritizes roles that reflect both my strengths and viable entry points‚Äîhelping surface fewer, higher-value opportunities and reduce time spent on low-fit applications
> ‚ö†Ô∏è **This is a redacted version.** Personal document links, API credentials, and private RSS feeds have been removed for security.

### üîß The system:
1. **Collects** postings from targeted RSS feeds for selected tech companies.  
2. **Filters** irrelevant and senior-level roles before processing.  
3. **Deduplicates** jobs already logged in Google Sheets.  
4. **Enriches** job data with company metadata, keywords, and technical/functional skill extraction using GPT.  
5. **Parses** my resume into structured JSON for skill-matching.  
6. **Scores** job fit on a custom 1‚Äì5 scale designed for my industry pivot.  
7. **Generates** tailored, ATS-friendly cover letters.  
8. **Updates** a Google Sheet with clean, consistent job records.

## üìö Lessons Learned
- Stronger **front-end filtering** saves time, tokens, and cleanup.  
- Direct API connections (Google Docs) are more reliable than scraping.  
- A clean caching system improves stability and efficiency.  
- Ranking logic must be **customized to your pivot**.
- **Career pivot scoring** requires different logic than traditional skill matching.

## üöÄ How to Run Locally
> ‚ö†Ô∏è **This repo contains multiple versions of the workflow.** For the most recent and recommended setup, use n8n Job_Search_Automation_v3.json. Version 1, and 2 are included for historical reference.
1. Clone this repo.  
2. Import `Job_Search_Automation_v3.json` into n8n.  
3. Add environment variables:  
   - `OPENAI_API_KEY`  
   - Google API credentials for **Sheets** and **Docs**  
4. Replace RSS feed URLs with your own target company feeds.  
5. Trigger manually or schedule daily runs.
