## Overview
This workflow automates the sourcing, filtering, enrichment, and ranking of job postings in San Francisco‚Äôs tech sector. It specifically targets business operations, product operations, and project coordination roles that align with my transferable experience.

Originally built to support my transition from high performance kitchen operations into tech, the system now includes a revamped ranking model. Instead of just skill overlap, it focuses on real world hiring likelihood. It prioritizes roles that reflect both my strengths and viable entry points helping surface fewer, higher value opportunities and reduce time spent on low fit applications
> ‚ö†Ô∏è **This is a redacted version.** Personal document links, API credentials, and private RSS feeds have been removed for security.

### üîß The system:
1. **Collects** postings from targeted RSS feeds for selected tech companies.  
2. **Filters** irrelevant and senior level roles before processing.  
3. **Deduplicates** jobs already logged in Google Sheets.  
4. **Enriches** job data with company metadata, keywords, and technical/functional skill extraction using GPT.  
5. **Parses** my resume into structured JSON for matching.  
6. **Scores** job fit on a custom 1‚Äì5 scale designed for my industry pivot.  
7. **Generates** tailored, ATS riendly base cover letter.  
8. **Updates** a Google Sheet with clean, consistent job records.
## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Improvements

###  Key Improvements in v2
- **Improved Job Data Collection -** Expanded extracted fields to include role descriptions, functional keywords, technical skills, and richer company metadata.
- **Updated Ranking System for Skill Alignment -** Rebuilt the scoring logic to weight technical overlaps and domain fit more heavily, ensuring high scores only go to truly relevant roles.
###  Key Improvements in v3
- **RSS Rate Limiting -** Staggered RSS feed collection to respect RSS.app service limits.
- **Fixed Loop Conflicts -** Resolved Split in Batches timing issues that caused incomplete processing.

## üìö Lessons Learned
- Stronger front-end filtering saves time, tokens, and cleanup.  
- Direct API connections (Google Docs) are more reliable than scraping.  
- A clean caching system improves stability and efficiency.  
- Ranking logic must be customized to your pivot.
- Career pivot scoring requires different logic than traditional skill matching.

## üöÄ How to Run Locally
> ‚ö†Ô∏è **This repo contains multiple versions of the workflow.** For the most recent and recommended setup, use n8n Job_Search_Automation_v3.json. Version 1, and 2 are included for historical reference.
1. Clone this repo.  
2. Import `Job_Search_Automation_v3.json` into n8n.  
3. Add environment variables:  
   - `OPENAI_API_KEY`  
   - Google API credentials for **Sheets** and **Docs**  
4. Replace RSS feed URLs with your own target company feeds.  
5. Trigger manually or schedule daily runs.
